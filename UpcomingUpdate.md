## Version 2.0.2

### Fixed
- Added that it removes an trailing " -" at the end if the title contains like "Solo leveling -". This makes it so if in example title name is "Solo leveling - Chapter 20" it would be displayed as "Solo leveling" instead of "Solo leveling -". This was an issue mainly in the default scraping methods.


### Removed
- 

### Added
- Expanded the recognition of sites by including it to check for "manhua" and "manwha" urls. Previously it was unable to check websites like "topmanhua" because the program only checked "manga/anime" domains.

### To Do
- Making sure that the program works on linux too.
- Expand the chapter count to show "Vol" instead of "Ch" if you are reading volumes.
