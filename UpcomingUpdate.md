### To Do
- The program sometimes doesn't start on different pcs. The reason is currently unknown. When I tested it on a clean virtual machine, it worked fine, so I don't really know where the issue lies. My first thought was that it's something to do with the startup script, but since a clean virtual machine can start it up, I don't really know the reason for the unexpected launching problem
- Making sure that the program works on linux too.
