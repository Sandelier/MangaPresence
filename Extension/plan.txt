1. Popup html opens 
2. Popup html asks background script if the server is on.
3. If its not then popup html just shows "Server offline" in the middle.
4. If its on then it would show an pipette tool and other buttons with familiarArray/ExcludedArray/Preferences.
5. Clicking familiarArray/ExcludedArray/Preferences would ask backgroundscript for them and atleast show the values they contain and i will see if i make it that you can edit them too in the popup html.
6. Clicking the pipette tool brings out two buttons that first button would make the query work for the whole domain and second button would an inputfield where you can input the url.
7. Then it would bring checkbox of which thing the queryselector is for. Is it for chapters/episodes or is it title.
8. Then when you click the button, pipette tool would send message to background script that then sends an message to contentscript
9. Contentscript then checks which elements you are hovering over and could show like an overlay
10. Overlay could have maybe at the bottom right "Exit" and the element it has currently selected
11. Then when you press "Exit" the contentscript sends an message to background script
12. Background script would then send it to the server.
13. Server would try to add the new queryselector to the file and it would check if there is same link already and if there is then it appends the new queryselector to it if its missing the queryselector.
14. If server can update it then it would read the familiarArray again and send it to the extension.
