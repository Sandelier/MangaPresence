### To do

2. Remove unneccessary librarys like websocket.
3. make it so that it closes up after couple minutes if there has not been any talking. basically after couple minutes of no messages it would check if it can find firefox process and if it cant then close off the server.
4. Could look for an better windows tray library to minimize the bundled exe size
7. Maybe make the how discord presence looks like itno an config file so they can change it themself?

### Bugs

1. Pkg cant bundle discord-rpc into the executable
